Title: Adaptive Builder for Formatted Strings
Version: 0.2.3
Author: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Maintainer: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Description: Provides a set of functions to facilitate building formatted strings
    under various replacement rules: C-style formatting, variable-based formatting,
    and number-based formatting. C-style formatting is basically identical to built-in
    function 'sprintf'. Variable-based formatting allows users to put variable names
    in a formatted string which will be replaced by variable values. Number-based
    formatting allows users to use index numbers to represent the corresponding
    argument value to appear in the string.
